# nteract.io

Welcome! This is the main site for nteract!

We serve an express app that does [server rendered react using next](https://zeit.co/blog/next) and proxy `https://nteract.github.io` for all other routes. 😁

## Development

```
git clone https://github.com/nteract/nteract.io
cd nteract.io
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

We run [nteract.io](https://nteract.io/) on [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now). If your PR gets merged, it will automatically get deployed and if successful aliased as the 🆕 nteract.io. 🎉

### Deploying by Hand

You'll need `now` to deploy:

```
npm install -g now
```

To do a test deployment run:
