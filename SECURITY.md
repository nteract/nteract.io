## Security

Security is an important part of software and we want to work with you to ensure that nteract is a safe and secure platform. This document outlines the processes for reporting security vulnerabilities in nteract apps and libraries.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by sending an email to [safia at safia dot rocks]() and [willingc at gmail dot com]().

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your security vulnerability report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer security issues be reported in English for clarity, but other languages are permitted if reporting in English will hinder the submission of the report.
