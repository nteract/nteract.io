              The nteract core SDK and application suite provide an interface
              for building and interacting with notebook UIs. But there's so
              much more to notebooks! Our collection of libraries allows you to
              execute notebooks headlessly, generate reports from notebooks for
              members of your organization, and more.

                notebook versions over time as checkpoints are made during
                authoring. It also grants the ability to publish specific
                notebook versions as a mechanism for sharing stable notebook
                versions with colleagues.
